# Easytime - FiveM Time and Weather 
![Easytime script](https://i.imgur.com/IEPmENN.png)

### Standalone

Easytime is a small but useful UI for FiveM server administrators which allows them to manipulate time and weather with a click of a button!

-   15 Different weather types
-   Animated time slider
-   Blackout
-   Dynamic weather
-   Config options to change the rain/thunder/snow chances.
-   Natural weather cycles

We have created natural weather cycles, so when dynamic weather is enabled, it will cycle through each group to make weather changes feel more natural, instead of instantly switching from sunny to thunder within seconds. If dynamic weather is enabled and you change the weather, it will continue through the natural weather cycle. It will not repeat the same cycle twice in a row.
### Instructions
**IF YOU ARE USING SHELLS, TRIGGER THIS EVENT WHEN A PLAYER ENTERS A SHELL TO SET THE TIME TO NIGHT** (the script will stop syncing for said player when this has been triggered).
    `TriggerEvent('cd_easytime:PauseSync', true)`


**TO RESYNC THE PLAYER WITH THE REST OF THE SERVER, TRIGGER THIS EVENT WHEN THE PLAYER LEAVES THE SHELL.**
  `TriggerEvent('cd_easytime:PauseSync', false)`
